# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the Lessons section in the .cursorrules file so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also use the .cursorrules file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Tools

Note all the tools are in python. So in the case you need to do batch processing, you can always consult the python files and write your own script.

## Screenshot Verification

The screenshot verification workflow allows you to capture screenshots of web pages and verify their appearance using LLMs. The following tools are available:

1. Screenshot Capture:
```bash
venv/bin/python tools/screenshot_utils.py URL [--output OUTPUT] [--width WIDTH] [--height HEIGHT]
```

2. LLM Verification with Images:
```bash
venv/bin/python tools/llm_api.py --prompt "Your verification question" --provider {openai|anthropic} --image path/to/screenshot.png
```

Example workflow:
```python
from screenshot_utils import take_screenshot_sync
from llm_api import query_llm

# Take a screenshot
screenshot_path = take_screenshot_sync('https://example.com', 'screenshot.png')

# Verify with LLM
response = query_llm(
    "What is the background color and title of this webpage?",
    provider="openai",  # or "anthropic"
    image_path=screenshot_path
)
print(response)
```

## LLM

You always have an LLM at your side to help you with the task. For simple tasks, you could invoke the LLM by running the following command:

venv/bin/python ./tools/llm_api.py --prompt "What is the capital of France?" --provider "anthropic"

The LLM API supports multiple providers:
• OpenAI (default, model: gpt-4o)
• Azure OpenAI (model: configured via AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT in .env file, defaults to gpt-4o-ms)
• DeepSeek (model: deepseek-chat)
• Anthropic (model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229)
• Gemini (model: gemini-pro)
• Local LLM (model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ)

But usually it's a better idea to check the content of the file and use the APIs in the tools/llm_api.py file to invoke the LLM if needed.

## Web browser

You could use the tools/web_scraper.py file to scrape the web.

venv/bin/python ./tools/web_scraper.py --max-concurrent 3 URL1 URL2 URL3

This will output the content of the web pages.

## Search engine

You could use the tools/search_engine.py file to search the web.

venv/bin/python ./tools/search_engine.py "your search keywords"

This will output the search results in the following format:

URL: https://example.com
Title: This is the title of the search result
Snippet: This is a snippet of the search result

If needed, you can further use the web_scraper.py file to scrape the web page content.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

• You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
• Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
• Read the file before you try to edit it.
• Due to Cursor's limit, when you use git and gh and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use git commit -F <filename> or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

• For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
• Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
• When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
• Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
• In Tailwind CSS, avoid using invalid classes like 'border-border' - use standard CSS properties or valid Tailwind classes instead
• In React contexts, always check the actual export names - NotificationContext exports 'useNotifications' (plural), not 'useNotification' (singular)

## Current Task: Tenant Discount System Implementation

### Task Explanation:
User requested adding a "discount" section to cover cases where tenants can opt-in for discounts by master tenant. This system should allow master tenants to apply discounts to specific tenants for various reasons (loyalty, maintenance help, etc.).

### Planning Steps:
[X] Add TenantDiscount interface to types
[X] Update TenantShare interface to include optional discount field
[X] Add discount management functions to TenantManagement interface
[X] Update mock data with sample discount examples
[X] Implement discount management functions in mockData.ts
[X] Create DiscountForm component for adding/editing discounts
[X] Update TenantManagement component to show discount information
[X] Add discount management buttons (Add/Remove Discount)
[X] Update SubtenantDashboard to display tenant's discount details

### Progress:
✅ COMPLETED: TenantDiscount interface with percentage/fixed types
✅ COMPLETED: Updated TenantShare interface with optional discount
✅ COMPLETED: Extended TenantManagement with discount methods
✅ COMPLETED: Sample discount data for Alice (10% loyalty) and Bob (RM50 maintenance)
✅ COMPLETED: Discount calculation and management functions
✅ COMPLETED: DiscountForm component with validation and date ranges
✅ COMPLETED: TenantManagement component shows discount info and controls
✅ COMPLETED: SubtenantDashboard displays rent details with discount section

### Discount System Features:
✅ Support for percentage-based discounts (e.g., 10% off)
✅ Support for fixed-amount discounts (e.g., RM50 off)
✅ Reason tracking for transparency
✅ Start/end date management for time-limited discounts
✅ Active/inactive status control
✅ Master tenant attribution tracking
✅ Automatic discount calculation
✅ Visual discount display in tenant cards
✅ Tenant dashboard showing their discount benefits

### User Interface Enhancements:
✅ Green-themed discount indicators for positive visual feedback
✅ Clear "before/after" pricing display
✅ Conditional buttons (Add Discount vs Remove Discount)
✅ Form validation for discount values and reasons
✅ Mobile-responsive discount information display
✅ Savings calculation display for tenants

### Technical Implementation:
✅ Type-safe discount interfaces
✅ Comprehensive validation (percentage ≤ 100%, positive values)
✅ Date range validation
✅ Clean separation of discount logic
✅ Notification system integration
✅ Proper error handling and user feedback

### Final Status:
✅ Discount system fully implemented and functional
✅ Master tenants can add/remove discounts for any tenant
✅ Tenants can view their discount details and savings
✅ All previous features maintained (tenant management, WiFi, etc.)
✅ Responsive design across all discount-related UI
✅ No compilation errors or issues
✅ Enhanced tenant management capabilities
✅ Improved tenant experience with discount transparency
